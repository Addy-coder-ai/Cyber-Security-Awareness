    <p id = "subp">In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network.</p>
    <br>
    <h1 id = "subp">In an Open Systems Interconnection module(OSI)(A flow of the executon of the steps of interconnection) there are many layers. a DDoS attack comes in the 3rd and 4th layer(Infrastructure Layer) and in the 6th and 7th layer(Application Layer)</h1>
    <h2 id = "ddosid">Infrastructure layer:</h2>
    <p id = "subpddos">Attacks at Layer 3 and 4, are typically categorized as Infrastructure layer attacks. These are also the most common type of DDoS attack and include vectors like synchronized (SYN) floods and other reflection attacks like User Datagram Packet (UDP) floods. These attacks are usually large in volume and aim to overload the capacity of the network or the application servers. But fortunately, these are also the type of attacks that have clear signatures and are easier to detect.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id = "ddosid">Application Layer</h2>
    <p id = "subpddos">Attacks at Layer 6 and 7, are often categorized as Application layer attacks. While these attacks are less common, they also tend to be more sophisticated. These attacks are typically small in volume compared to the Infrastructure layer attacks but tend to focus on particular expensive parts of the application thereby making it unavailable for real users. For instance, a flood of HTTP requests to a login page, or an expensive search API, or even Wordpress XML-RPC floods (also known as Wordpress pingback attacks).</p>
